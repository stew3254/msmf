# Minecraft Server Management Framework

This collection of software will be used to assist in running Minecraft servers. By running server.go, you start the webserver which will serve the contents of the web files in the static directory. From here, servers will be able to be started, stopped, configured, backed up, updated and more. This project is very early in development and more is to come.
